  "response": "```javascript\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`function add(a, b)`:** This defines a function named `add` that takes two arguments: `a` and `b`.  These arguments will be the numbers you want to add.\n* **`return a + b;`:** This line performs the addition.  It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and then *returns* the result. The `return` statement is crucial because it sends the calculated value back to wherever the `add` function was called.  Without `return`, the function wouldn't actually provide a usable result.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n```javascript\nlet num1 = 5;\nlet num2 = 10;\nlet sum = add(num1, num2); // Call the add function with num1 and num2\nconsole.log(sum); // Output: 15\n```\n\n**Key improvements over your original code:**\n\n* **Arguments:** The function now accepts arguments (`a` and `b`) to specify the numbers to add. This makes the function much more flexible.\n* **`return` statement:** The `return` statement is essential for the function to actually produce a result that can be used elsewhere in your code.  Without it, the function wouldn't give you back the sum.\n* **Clearer Syntax:**  The code is formatted for better readability.\n\n**Why your original code didn't work:**\n\n* **No arguments:** The original function `add()` didn't take any arguments, so there was no way to tell it what numbers to add.\n* **No `return` statement:** Even if you had variables `a` and `b` defined outside the function, the original code wouldn't have returned the result of `a + b`. The result would have been calculated but then lost.\n"
